# gobek (Local GUI / Go Chrome Framework)

gobek is a simple framework made for developing localhosted software that can reuse chrome/chromium or embed chromium (in future releases). Both available in deployment for the applications.

This framework uses Chrome (Windows) or Chromium (Linux) as frontend by opening them with cmd/terminal and hosting a localhost webserver, while opening chrome/chromium with --app and --user-directory arguments. The frontend can be changed by the user in runtime, while the backend needs to be compiled/build. The API can be decoupled in future versions, so every part of the application is changeable - Sustainable development. Frontends is easy to change. Alternatives to this is embedding a chromium or webview framework into the project, which will require more space. I chose to depend on Chrome/Chromium, as they are market leaders and html/css/javascript technology frontrunners.

Feel free to use this piece of software, I will be happy to assist you

I am currently working on this project, it will be updated and maintained. I consider it production ready.

This project is used by Beksoft ApS for projects such as:
* BekCMS
* PingPong Game made in Three.js
* Several local webbased software projects

## How to use (download example project)
The best way to start using the project is to download the example project at:
https://github.com/lmbek/gobek-example

This example project uses this package and combines it with a local api
Then the Go api is being developed and customized by you together with the frontend (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

## How to use (with go get)
first run the following in CMD (with go installed)
<code>go get github.com/lmbek/gobek</code>
Example: how to add framework to main.go
<pre>
package main

import (
	"api"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/lmbek/gobek/fileserver"
	"github.com/lmbek/gobek/launcher"
	"os"
)

// For windows, we need an organisation name and project name
var organisationName = "NewOrganisationName" 
var projectName = "NewProjectName"           

// Set frontend path (where we have all the: html, css, javascript...)
var frontendPath = "./frontend" 

var chromeLauncher = launcher.ChromeLauncher{
	Location:                os.Getenv("programfiles") + "\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe",
	FrontendInstallLocation: os.Getenv("localappdata") + "\\Google\\Chrome\\InstalledApps\\" + organisationName + "\\" + projectName,
}

var chromiumLauncher = launcher.DefaultChromiumLauncher // default chrome or chromium launcher settings can be used like this

func main() {
	//api.Init() // need to be added by you (example on gobek-example)
	err := launcher.StartDefault(frontendPath, chromeLauncher, chromiumLauncher)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
</pre>
Please do note however that using the main.go from the gobek-example project is recommended
## How to test
<code>go test ./tests/...</code>

## How to run
make your own main.go by following https://github.com/lmbek/gobek-example

## How to apply manifest and logo to executible
Use something like goversioninfo: https://github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo

## How to build
<code>go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui -o NewProjectName.exe</code>
