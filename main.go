// ** Generating and Building **
// The above is the generate commands to add icon and manifest to binary,
// and the build command
// NOTE: GoPackager.exe is a modified version of goversioninfo.
// You can find goversioninfo at https://github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo

// ** Reason Of Framework Explained **
// This application is meant to find a port and launch a frontend in chrome (windows) or chromium (linux).
// Meanwhile, it will open a http localhost backend with an api.
// The API package at ./backend/api/ can be replaced to fit another application,
// if the framework is to be used for other applications.
// It is important to note, that the system will require a frontend directory and a data directory,
// when the application is tested and released, these will also need to be managed (other applications can be put in)
// This framework is very open-source, since when released to users, the users can modify the frontend files.
// However the backend can be kept as binary, but sent to users if they later want to modify it,
// for example users must be able to modify the application backend, and replace the binary with the modified version.
